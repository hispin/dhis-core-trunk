    <title>Data Administration in DHIS 2</title>
      <para>The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is optimal. </para>
      <section id="dataBrowser">
        <title>Data browser</title>
        <para>The data browser maintenance module allows the user to produce a summary of the data contained in the DHIS2 database. This summary provides the number of data element values that have been recorded for a given time interval and then grouped by the following options:</para>
        <itemizedlist>

        <para>Each of these options can be accessed by selecting the desired option from  <guilabel>&quot;Browse by&quot; </guilabel>drop-down menu. </para>
        <para>In order to produce a summary of submitted data for a given period and grouped by data sets, the user should follow this procedure. Begin by selecting a given periodicity type (e.g. Weekly, monthly, yearly, etc) and then a time interval (e.g. January 2009 to March 2009). Select the type of summary to be produced (e.g. Dataset) from the &quot;Browse by&quot; drop-down menu. Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button to view the summary. </para>

      <section id="dataIntegrity">
        <title>Data integrity</title>
        <para>DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database. Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues. </para>
        <section>
          <title>Data elements without data set</title>
          <para>Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-&gt;Datasets-&gt;Edit from the main menu and then add the &quot;orphaned&quot; data element to the appropriate data set. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data elements without groups</title>
          <para>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the PivotSource recordsets that `feed` the pivot tables. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data Element Groups to review each Data Element identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</title>
          <para>Data Elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data sets not assigned to organisation units</title>
          <para>All data sets should be assigned to at least one organisation unit. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Indicators with identical formulas</title>
          <para>Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify  any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Indicators without groups</title>
          <para>All Data Elements and Indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` Indicators to its correct group.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid indicator numerators</title>
          <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the numerator definition. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid indicator denominators</title>
          <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the denominator definition. </para>

          <title> Organisation units with cyclic references</title>
          <para>Organisation units cannot be both parent and children of each other, directly nor indirectly.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Orphaned organisation units</title>
          <para>All organisation units must exist within the organisation unit hierarchy. Go to Organisation-&gt;Hierarchy Operations and move the offending organisation unit into the proper position in the hierarchy. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Organisation units without groups</title>
          <para>All organisation units <emphasis>must</emphasis> be allocated to at least <emphasis>one</emphasis> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the `compulsory` rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to  Maintenance -&gt; Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one `compulsory` Group Set (the group set `OrgUnitType` are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Organisation units violating compulsory group sets</title>
          <para>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <emphasis>compulsory</emphasis> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as `compulsory`, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the `organisation unitType` group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other `type` group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.  Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Allocate all organisation units to exactly one group. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Organisation units violating exclusive group sets</title>
          <para>Some organisation units have been allocated to several organisation unit groups that are members of the same exclusive organisation unit group set. When a group set is defined as exclusive, it means that an organisation unit can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> organisation unit group within that Group Set. For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the &apos;Hospital&apos; and &apos;Clinic&apos; groups , but rather to only to one of them. Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Remove the organisation unit from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title> Organisation unit groups without group sets</title>
          <para>The organisation unit groups listed here have not been allocated to a group set. Go to Maintenance-&gt;Organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and allocate the Organisation unit group to the appropriate group set. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Validation rules without groups</title>
          <para>All validation rules must be assigned to a group. Go to <command>Services-&gt;Data quality-&gt;Validation rule group</command> and assign the offending validation rule to a group. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid validation rule left side expressions</title>
          <para>An error exists in the left-side validation rule definition. Go to <command>Services-&gt;Data quality-&gt;Validation rule</command> and click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon on the offending rule. Press &quot;Edit left side&quot; and make the corrections that are required. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid validation rule right side expressions</title>
          <para>An error exists in the left-side validation rule definition. Go to <command>Services-&gt;Data quality-&gt;Validation rule</command> and click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon on the offending rule. Press &quot;Edit right side&quot; and make the corrections that are required.</para>

      <section id="dataArchive">
	    <title>Data Archive</title>
	    <para>The purpose of the data archive function is to move data which is currently not being used for analysis to a secondary storage location in order to improve performance of the application. Data can be both archived and unarchived. When archiving data one moves it from the primary storage to the secondary storage location, while unarchiving moves it from the secondary storage location to the primary. Analysis functionality in DHIS 2 heavily utilizes queries to the data value database table, and by reducing the size of this table these operations will be significantly faster. Typically one would want to archive data that is older than two years.</para>
	    <para>To archive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be archived. Then press the archive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
	    <para>To unarchive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be unarchived. Then press the unarchive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
	    <para>In some cases you might end up with overlapping data. For instance one might archive data for a given timespan, then later enter data for a period in that timespan. In such cases the system will automatically overwrite the oldest of the overlapping values with the newest during the archive or unarchive operation.</para>

    <title>Overview of data quality check</title>
    <para>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Completeness:</emphasis> Data for all data elements for all health facilities/blocks/Taluka/districts should have been submitted.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Consistency:</emphasis> Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar facilities.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>

    <title>Data quality checks</title>
    <para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element over the last six months or as defined by the user.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and Organization Unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Analysis of data sets, ie. examining gaps in data.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data triangulation which is comparing the same data or indicator from different sources.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Data quality check at the point of data entry </title>
    <para>Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the DHIS 2 if there is historical data available for that data element.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </title>
      <para>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value. A pop-up window will appear in which you can enter the vaules. On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction. On the data entry screen the users also have the option to add a comment on how the discrepant figure might be explained (if required). This you can do by using the drop down menu of the ‘comment’ box. In case you are using the custom data entry screen which is displayed when you deselect the ‘default data entry form’ option on the top right corner of the screen. In this case the minimum and maximum values can be added by double-clicking on the data entry box instead of the data element.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Generated min-max values </title>
      <para>It is possible to generate the min-max value, element-wise, using the DHIS2. In such case you merely need to click on the ‘Generate min-max’ button near the upper right corner. In case of default data entry screen the min and max values, when generated, will appear on the left and right side of the data entry box. In case you deselect the default data entry form the generated values will appear on the top right end of the screen.</para>

  <section id="validationRule">
    <title>Validation Rule</title>
    <para>This module provides management of validation rules. A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator  which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criterias are met. For instance, a validation rule could  assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</para>
    <para>To add a validation rule, click the add new button. First, provide a descriptive <emphasis role="italic">name</emphasis> for the validation rule. The  name must be unique among the validation rules. Second, provide a description for the validation rule. Third, select an operator. The  operator options are <emphasis role="italic">equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">not equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than or equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than or equal to</emphasis>. Then define the left side and right side of the validation rule expression. First, provde a description for the expression. Second, build the expression with the expression builder. The expression is mathematical and contain data elements as well as integers and mathematical operators. Data elements can be included by double-clicking  one in  the available data elements list to the righ. Alternatively one can  select a data element and click the insert button. Mathematical operators can be included by clicking the corresponding button under the expression builder area. Save the expression by clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>, then save the validation rule by clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>To edit a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">edit</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list. Then follow the same producedures as  above.</para>
    <para>To delete a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">delete</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</para>
    <para>To view validation rule details, click the <emphasis role="italic">view details</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</para>
  </section>
  <section  id="validationRuleGroup">
    <title>Validation Rule Group</title>
    <para>A validation rule group provides a mechanism for classifying related data elements. Another advantate of using validation rule grops is that it can later be run separately, contrary to running all validation rules.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="validationRuleAnalysis">
    <title>Validation Rule Analysis</title>
    <para>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data in the system. Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition defined through the validation rule expression is not met, ie. the condition is false. </para>
    <para>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis. The date picker widget may be used to select dates. Second, choose between including all validation rules or a single group. Third, choose between including the selected organisation unit only or the selected organisation unit with all children in the analysis. Fourth, select the organisation unit. Finally, click <emphasis role="italic">validate</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>The analysis process while run for a while dependending on the amount of data that is being anaylysed. If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying <emphasis role="italic">validation passed successfully</emphasis> is displayed. If there were validation violations they will be presented in a list. The organisation unit, period, left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation. This will open a popup screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to correct incorrect data.</para>
    <para>The validation violations can be exported to a PDF document by clicking on the export to PDF button and to a Microsoft Excel workbook by clicking on the export to workbook button.</para>

  <section id="stddevoutlierAnalysis">
    <title>Std Dev Outlier Analysis</title>
    <para>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance but they often indicate either measurement error or a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them while in the latter case one should be cautios in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution. The analysis is based on the standard normal distribution.</para>
    <para>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. Fourth, select the parent organisation unit to use. All children of the organisation unit will be included. Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard devations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an outlier.</para>
    <para>The possible outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished. The data element, organisation unit, period, minimum value, actual value, maximum value will be displayed for each outlier. The minimum and maximum value refers to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis. Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="minmaxoutlierAnalysis">
    <title>Min-Max Outlier Analysis</title>
    <para>The min-max value based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are outside the  defined minimum and maximum values. Minimum and maximum values can be custom defined or automatically defined by the system in the data entry module. See section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="gapAnalysis">
    <title>Gap Analysis</title>
    <para>The gap analysis provides a mechanism for revealing gaps in the data. A gap exists in the context of a data element and organisation unit. A gap is defined as a period with  preceding and succeeding periods which have registered data values, but without registered data values itself. Such a gap might indicate a data capture error or omission and could be further investigated.  See section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="followupAnalysis">
    <title>Follow-Up Analysis</title>
    <para>The follow-up analysis function will list all data values which are marked for follup-up. A data value can be marked for follow-up in the data entry module and in the other validation analysis variants in this module.  See section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>
