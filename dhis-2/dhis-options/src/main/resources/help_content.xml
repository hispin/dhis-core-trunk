    <title>Data Administration in DHIS 2</title>
      <para>The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is optimal. </para>
      <section id="dataBrowser">
        <title>Data browser</title>
        <para>The data browser maintenance module allows the user to produce a summary of the data contained in the DHIS2 database. This summary provides the number of data element values that have been recorded for a given time interval and then grouped by the following options:</para>
        <itemizedlist>

        <para>Each of these options can be accessed by selecting the desired option from  <guilabel>&quot;Browse by&quot; </guilabel>drop-down menu. </para>
        <para>In order to produce a summary of submitted data for a given period and grouped by data sets, the user should follow this procedure. Begin by selecting a given periodicity type (e.g. Weekly, monthly, yearly, etc) and then a time interval (e.g. January 2009 to March 2009). Select the type of summary to be produced (e.g. Dataset) from the &quot;Browse by&quot; drop-down menu. Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button to view the summary. </para>

      <section id="dataIntegrity">
        <title>Data integrity</title>
        <para>DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database. Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues. </para>
        <section>
          <title>Data elements without data set</title>
          <para>Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-&gt;Datasets-&gt;Edit from the main menu and then add the &quot;orphaned&quot; data element to the appropriate data set. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data elements without groups</title>
          <para>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the PivotSource recordsets that `feed` the pivot tables. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data Element Groups to review each Data Element identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</title>
          <para>Data Elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data sets not assigned to organisation units</title>
          <para>All data sets should be assigned to at least one organisation unit. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Indicators with identical formulas</title>
          <para>Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify  any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Indicators without groups</title>
          <para>All Data Elements and Indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` Indicators to its correct group.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid indicator numerators</title>
          <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the numerator definition. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid indicator denominators</title>
          <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the denominator definition. </para>

          <title> Organisation units with cyclic references</title>
          <para>Organisation units cannot be both parent and children of each other, directly nor indirectly.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Orphaned organisation units</title>
          <para>All organisation units must exist within the organisation unit hierarchy. Go to Organisation-&gt;Hierarchy Operations and move the offending organisation unit into the proper position in the hierarchy. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Organisation units without groups</title>
          <para>All organisation units <emphasis>must</emphasis> be allocated to at least <emphasis>one</emphasis> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the `compulsory` rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to  Maintenance -&gt; Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one `compulsory` Group Set (the group set `OrgUnitType` are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Organisation units violating compulsory group sets</title>
          <para>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <emphasis>compulsory</emphasis> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as `compulsory`, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the `organisation unitType` group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other `type` group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.  Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Allocate all organisation units to exactly one group. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Organisation units violating exclusive group sets</title>
          <para>Some organisation units have been allocated to several organisation unit groups that are members of the same exclusive organisation unit group set. When a group set is defined as exclusive, it means that an organisation unit can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> organisation unit group within that Group Set. For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the &apos;Hospital&apos; and &apos;Clinic&apos; groups , but rather to only to one of them. Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Remove the organisation unit from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title> Organisation unit groups without group sets</title>
          <para>The organisation unit groups listed here have not been allocated to a group set. Go to Maintenance-&gt;Organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and allocate the Organisation unit group to the appropriate group set. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Validation rules without groups</title>
          <para>All validation rules must be assigned to a group. Go to <command>Services-&gt;Data quality-&gt;Validation rule group</command> and assign the offending validation rule to a group. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid validation rule left side expressions</title>
          <para>An error exists in the left-side validation rule definition. Go to <command>Services-&gt;Data quality-&gt;Validation rule</command> and click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon on the offending rule. Press &quot;Edit left side&quot; and make the corrections that are required. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Invalid validation rule right side expressions</title>
          <para>An error exists in the left-side validation rule definition. Go to <command>Services-&gt;Data quality-&gt;Validation rule</command> and click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon on the offending rule. Press &quot;Edit right side&quot; and make the corrections that are required.</para>

      <section id="dataArchive">
	    <title>Data Archive</title>
	    <para>The purpose of the data archive function is to move data which is currently not being used for analysis to a secondary storage location in order to improve performance of the application. Data can be both archived and unarchived. When archiving data one moves it from the primary storage to the secondary storage location, while unarchiving moves it from the secondary storage location to the primary. Analysis functionality in DHIS 2 heavily utilizes queries to the data value database table, and by reducing the size of this table these operations will be significantly faster. Typically one would want to archive data that is older than two years.</para>
	    <para>To archive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be archived. Then press the archive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
	    <para>To unarchive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be unarchived. Then press the unarchive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
	    <para>In some cases you might end up with overlapping data. For instance one might archive data for a given timespan, then later enter data for a period in that timespan. In such cases the system will automatically overwrite the oldest of the overlapping values with the newest during the archive or unarchive operation.</para>
