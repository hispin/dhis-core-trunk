        <title>Data elements</title>
        <para>Data elements form the basis of DHIS2. Data elements define what is actually recorded in system, e.g. number of immunisations or number of cases of malaria. The actual creation and definition of the data elements themselves are far beyond the scope of this manual to describe, but it is assumed that an administrator will be provided with a list of standardised data elements for inclusion into the DHIS2 system. </para>
        <para>To access the data element maintenance module, choose Maintenance-&gt;Data elements-&gt;Data element. </para>
        <para>The ‘Filter by name’ will allow you to filter a range of data elements if you know either the full name of the data element, or just a part of it. Type the name
               into the search field and any matching data elements are displayed below.
               You can also choose ‘Filter by group/view all’ to narrow down a data
               element search within a particular data element group. In default mode, this
               field will display all the data elements in the application.
               The ‘Get PDF’ button can be clicked to generate a .pdf file of all the data
               elements. The 'Sort' button can be used to sort the data elements into alphabetical order. </para>

        <title>Data element categories</title>
        <para>Data element categories can be used to disaggregate data elements into individual atomic components. Data element categories are typically a concept, such as Gender, Age or  Disease Status. Data elements such as "Number of cases of confirmed malaria" are often broken into smaller component parts to determine, for instance, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age groups. As an example, three data element categories: Under 1, 1-5 and Over 5 could be created. They could be assigned as categories to the data element, which would then create in the data entry screens, three separate fields for this data element namely: </para>
        <itemizedlist>

            <para>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Under 1)</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Effective use of data element categories greatly simplifies the process of setting up the DHIS2 system, as the data element categories can be reused to disaggregate many different data elements. Otherwise, each of the data elements listed above, would need to be created separately. Judicious use of data element categories will greatly simplify the DHIS2 implementation, and allow for subsequent advanced analysis. </para>
        <para>Data element categories are composed of category options. Category options must be defined when a data element category is created for the first time. Subsequent changes to the data element category, i.e.  adding or deleting new category options, are not allowed once the data element category has been created. </para>

      <section id="dataElementCategoryCombo">
        <title>Data element category combinations</title>
        <para>Data element category combinations allow multiple data element categories to be combined into a related set. As an example, a data element "Number of new HIV infections" might be disaggregated according to the following categories. </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Age: "Under 5", "5-15", "15-24", "24 and above"</para>

            <para>Gender: Male, Female</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para> In this example, there would be two levels of disaggregation, consisting of two separate data element categories, each consisting of several data element category options. In most HMIS systems, different data elements are disaggregated according to a common set of categories. By combining these different categories into a data element category combination and assigning these combinations to data elements, the appropriate disaggregation levels can be applied efficiently and quickly to a large number of data elements. </para>
        <para>To access the data element category combination maintenance module, select "Maintenance-&gt;Data element and indicators-&gt;Data element category combinations" from the main DHIS2 menu. As with the  other maintains modules, you can filter the listed category combinations by entering the name (or portion thereof) of the category combination. Other operations such as "Edit", "Delete" and "Information" should be familiar to the reader. </para>
        <para>To add a new category combination, click the "Add new" button. The following dialogue will be displayed. </para>

        <caution>
          <para>Categories can only be added to a category combination at this step. Categories can be removed from category combinations later by editing the category combination, however, it is not allowed to add additional categories once the combination has been created. Ensure that the category combination and its respective categories is final before you create the category combination and assign it to a data element. </para>

The problem might either be that you have not defined any `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the `compulsory` rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to  Maintenance -&gt; Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one `compulsory` Group Set (the group set `OrgUnitType` are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</para>

        <title>Organisation units violating compulsory group sets</title>
        <para>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <emphasis>compulsory</emphasis> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as `compulsory`, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the `organisation unitType` group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other `type` group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.  Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check.

When a group set is defined as exclusive, it means that an organisation unit can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> organisation unit group within that Group Set. For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the 'Hospital' and 'Clinic' groups , but rather to only to one of them.

      <title>Data Archive</title>
      <para>The purpose of the data archive function is to move data which is currently not being used for analysis to a secondary storage location in order to improve performance of the application. Data can be both archived and unarchived. When archiving data one moves it from the primary storage to the secondary storage location, while unarchiving moves it from the secondary storage location to the primary. Analysis functionality in DHIS 2 heavily utilizes queries to the data value database table, and by reducing the size of this table these operations will be significantly faster. Typically one would want to archive data that is older than two years.</para>
      <para>To archive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be archived. Then press the archive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
      <para>To unarchive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be unarchived. Then press the unarchive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
      <para>In some cases you might end up with overlapping data. For instance one might archive data for a given timespan, then later enter data for a period in that timespan. In such cases the system will automatically overwrite the oldest of the overlapping values with the newest during the archive or unarchive operation.</para>

      <title>Data quality check at the point of data entry </title>
      <para>Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the DHIS 2 if there is historical data available for that data element.
    </para>
      <section>
        <title>Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </title>
        <para>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value. A pop-up window will appear in which you can enter the vaules. On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction. On the data entry screen the users also have the option to add a comment on how the discrepant figure might be explained (if required). This you can do by using the drop down menu of the ‘comment’ box. In case you are using the custom data entry screen which is displayed when you deselect the ‘default data entry form’ option on the top right corner of the screen. In this case the minimum and maximum values can be added by double-clicking on the data entry box instead of the data element.</para>

    <section id="validationRule">
      <title>Validation Rule</title>
      <para>This module provides management of validation rules. A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator  which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criterias are met. For instance, a validation rule could  assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</para>
      <para>To add a validation rule, click the add new button. First, provide a descriptive <emphasis role="italic">name</emphasis> for the validation rule. The  name must be unique among the validation rules. Second, provide a description for the validation rule. Third, select an operator. The  operator options are <emphasis role="italic">equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">not equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than or equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than or equal to</emphasis>. Then define the left side and right side of the validation rule expression. First, provde a description for the expression. Second, build the expression with the expression builder. The expression is mathematical and contain data elements as well as integers and mathematical operators. Data elements can be included by double-clicking  one in  the available data elements list to the righ. Alternatively one can  select a data element and click the insert button. Mathematical operators can be included by clicking the corresponding button under the expression builder area. Save the expression by clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>, then save the validation rule by clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>To edit a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">edit</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list. Then follow the same producedures as  above.</para>

    <section id="validationRuleAnalysis">
      <title>Validation Rule Analysis</title>
      <para>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data in the system. Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition defined through the validation rule expression is not met, ie. the condition is false. </para>
      <para>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis. The date picker widget may be used to select dates. Second, choose between including all validation rules or a single group. Third, choose between including the selected organisation unit only or the selected organisation unit with all children in the analysis. Fourth, select the organisation unit. Finally, click <emphasis role="italic">validate</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>The analysis process while run for a while dependending on the amount of data that is being anaylysed. If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying <emphasis role="italic">validation passed successfully</emphasis> is displayed. If there were validation violations they will be presented in a list. The organisation unit, period, left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation. This will open a popup screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to correct incorrect data.</para>

    <section id="stddevoutlierAnalysis">
      <title>Std Dev Outlier Analysis</title>
      <para>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance but they often indicate either measurement error or a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them while in the latter case one should be cautios in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution. The analysis is based on the standard normal distribution.</para>
      <para>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. Fourth, select the parent organisation unit to use. All children of the organisation unit will be included. Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard devations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an outlier.</para>
      <para>The possible outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished. The data element, organisation unit, period, minimum value, actual value, maximum value will be displayed for each outlier. The minimum and maximum value refers to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis. Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</para>

    <title>What is import and export?</title>
    <para>In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed application, where the same application is running in different geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals, districts, and state). Most of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and hence they work offline. At some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be synchronised in order to have a consolidated database for the a particular geographical region. For this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which is working offline, say at the health facility  level) to another one say at the district level where the data would need to be imported. This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on Internet to some degree, as data updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS 2 provides robust export-import functionality to fulfil these needs.
</para>
  </section>
  <section id="export">
    <title>Exporting data</title>
    <para>In the case on on-line data entry, all data is saved into one database only. In an offline deployment, each deployment will have a separate database in their local system. So the data will be stored in their local database. In an offline deployment, after the data entry is finished, it will need to be manually sent to the next level of where the application is running.

      <title>Exporting from DHIS2</title>
      <para>The export option can be made use of by selecting it as follows. 
The import or export is available only when the selected organisation (source/destination) has defined datasets. This is because datasets help to define which data is to be or is being exported. Further, which specific data elements get exported is determined by the composition of the dataset being exported.
If there are no datasets defined for an organisation unit, it indicates that no data values are registered for this level of organisation or lower.

      <para>The import option allows different instance of DHIS2 to receive standardised set of data in the absence of a networked system. Typically, a data set is exported from one DHIS instance (e.g. a district level system) to another system (e.g. a provincial level system).  DHIS2 is capable of importing data from other systems that either support the DXF of IXF formats. DHIS2 is capable of importing data directly from a DHIS 1.4 Access database. Each of these options will be discussed in the following sections. </para>

</para>
          <para>If there are new data elements, indicators, or orgunits, first make sure whether they really are new or not. Data elements are rarely new, most of the time they are the old name of something that has been changed in the destination database (e.g. a master db at the national level). If you have changed some data elements names at the national level and these have not yet been updated in the district database, the old names that are in the district export files will appear as new data elements in your import preview. It is very important that you tell the DHIS that these are only just old names of a data element that already exists in your database, if not you will have two data elements meaning the same thing and both with an incomplete set of data. Use the ‘match new to existing’ button to link the new data elements (that really are old) to the updated names in your national database, and make sure that the source database updates its metdata before the next data export.  

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">If updates: </emphasis></para>
          <para>Only the newer updates are shown in the preview. This means the record has been updated more recently  in the district/hospital than in the zonal/national database you are importing into. If you are not sure whether you want to import the update or not, you can select the record and click on the compare to existing button to see exactly which changes that have been made in the updated object.

      <title>Types of data and aggregation</title>
      <para>
In the bigger picture of HIS terminology all data in DHIS are usually called aggregated as they are aggregates (e.g. monthly summaries) of medical records or some kind of service registers reported from the health facilities. Aggregation inside DHIS however, which is the topic here, is concerned with how the raw data captured in DHIS (through data entry or import)are further aggregated over time (e.g. from monthly to quarterly values) or up the organisational hierarchy (e.g. from facility to district values). 
</para>

        <title>Terminology</title>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Raw data</emphasis> refers to data that is registered into the DHIS 2 either through data entry or data import, and has not been manipulated by the DHIS aggregation process. All these data are stored in the table (or Java object if you prefer) called DataValue.

            <para><emphasis>Aggregated data</emphasis> refers to data that has been aggregated by the DHIS2, meaning it is no longer raw data, but some kind of aggregate of the raw data.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Indicator values</emphasis> can also be understood as aggregated data, but these are special in the way that they are calculated based on user defined formulas (factor * numerator/denominator). Indicator values are therefore processed data and not raw data, and are located in the aggregatedindicatorvalue table/object. Indicators are calculated at any level of the organisational hierarchy and these calculations are then based on the aggregated data values available at each level. A level attribute in the aggregateddatavalue table refers to the organisational level of the orgunit the value has been calculated for.

    <emphasis>Period and Period type</emphasis> are used to specify the time dimension of the raw or aggregated values, and data can be aggregated from one period type to another, e.g from monthly to quarterly, or daily to monthly. Each data value has one period and that period has one period type. E.g data values for the periods Jan, Feb, and Mar 2009, all of the monthly period type can be aggregated together to an aggregated data value with the period “Q1 2009” and period type “Quarterly”.

        <title>Basic rules of aggregation</title>
        <section>
          <title>What is added together</title>
          <para>Data (raw) can be registered at any organisational level, e.g. at at national hospital at level 2, a health facility at level 5, or at a bigger PHC at level 4. This varies form country to country, but DHIS is flexible in allowing data entry or data import to take place at any level. This means that orgunits that themselves have children can register data, sometimes the same data elements as their children units. The basic rule of aggregation in DHIS 2 is that <emphasis>all raw data is aggregated together</emphasis>, meaning data registered at a facility on level 5 is added to the data registered for a PHC at level 4.</para>
          <para>
It is up to the user/system administrator/designer to make sure that no duplication of data entry is taking place and that e.g. data entered at level 4 are not about the same services/visits that are reported by orgunit children at level 5. NOTE that in some cases you want to have “duplication” of data in the system, but in a controlled manner. E.g. when you have two different sources of data for population estimates, both level 5 catchment population data and another population data source for level 4 based on census data (because sum of level 5 catchments is not always the same as level 4 census data). Then you can specify using advanced aggregation settings (see further down) that the system should e.g. not add level 5 population data to the level 4 population data, and that level 3,2,1 population data aggregates are only based on level 4 data and does not include level 5 pop data.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>How data gets added together</title>
          <para>How data is aggregated depends on the dimension of aggregation (see further down).</para>
          <para>Along the orgunit level dimension data is always summed up, simply added together. Note that raw data is never percentages, and therefore can be summed together. Indicator values that can be percentages are treated differently (re-calculated at each level, never summed up).</para>
          <para>
Along the time dimension there are several possibilities, the two most common ways to aggregate are sum and average. The user can specify for each data element which method to use by setting the aggregation operator (see further down). Monthly service data are normally summed together over time, e.g. the number of vaccines given in a year is the sum of the vaccines given for each month of that year. For population, equipment, staff and other kind of what is often called semi-permanent data the average method is often the one to use, as, e.g. “number of nurses” working at a facility in a year would not be the sum of the two numbers reported in the six-monthly staffing report, but rather the average of the two numbers. More details further down under “aggregation operators”.

        <section>
          <title>Organisational units and levels</title>
          <para>Organisational units are used to represent the &quot;where&quot; dimension associated with data values. In DHIS2, organisational units are arranged in a hierarchy, which typically corresponds to the hierarchical nature of the organisation or country. Organisational unit levels correspond to the distinct levels within the hierarchy. For instance, a country maybe organized into provinces, then districts, then facilities, and then sub-centers. This organisational hierarchy would have five levels. Within each level, a number of organisational units would exist. During the aggregation process, data is aggregated from the lower organisational unit levels to higher levels. Depending on the aggregation operator, data may be &quot;summed&quot; or &quot;averaged&quot; within a given organisational unit level, to derive the aggregate total for all the organisational units that are contained within a higher level organisational unit level. For instance, if there are ten districts contained in a province and the aggregation operator for a given data element has been defined as &quot;SUM&quot;,  the aggregate total for the province would be calculated as the sum of the values of the individual ten distrincts contained in that province.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Period</title>
          <para>Periods are used to represent the &quot;when&quot; dimension associated with data values. Data can easily be aggregated from weeks to months, from months to quarters, and from quarters to years. DHIS2 uses known rules of how these different intervals are contained within other intervals (for instance Quarter 1 2010 is known to contain January 2010, February 2010 an March 2010) in order to aggregate data from smaller time intervals, e.g. weeks, into longer time intervals, e.g. months. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data Elements and Categories</title>
          <para>The data element dimension specifies &quot;what&quot; is being recorded by a particular data value. Data element categories are actually degenerate dimensions of the data element dimension, and are used to disaggregate the data element dimension into finer categories. Data element categories, such as &quot;Age&quot; and &quot;Gender&quot;, are used to record a particular data element, typically for differen population groups. These categories can then be used to calculate the overall total for the category  and the total of all categories. </para>

        <section>
          <title>Sum</title>
          <para>The &quot;sum&quot; operator simply calcuates the sum of all data values that are contained within a particular aggregation matrix. For instance, if data is recorded on a monthly basis at the district level and is aggregated to provincial quarterly totals, all data contained in all districts for a given province and all weeks for the given quarter will be added together to obtained the aggregate total.</para>

          <title>Average</title>
          <para>When the average aggregation operator is selected, the unweighted average of all data values within a given aggregation matrix. </para>
          <para>It is important to understand how DHIS2 treats null values in the context of the average operator. It is fairly common for some organisational units not to submit data for certain data elements. In the context of the average operator, the average results from the number of data elemements that are actually present (therefore NOT NULL) within a given aggregation matrix. If there are 12 districts within a given province, but only 10 of these have submitted data, the average aggreate will result from these ten values that are actually present in the database, and will not take into account the missing values.  </para>

          <title>Aggregation levels</title>
          <para>The normal rule of the system is to aggregate all raw data together when moving up the organisational hierarchy, and the system assumes that data entry is not being duplicated by entering “the same services provided to the same clients” at both facility level and also entering an “aggregated” (sum of all facilities) number at a higher level. This is to more easily facilitate aggregation when the same services are provided but to different clients/catchment populations at facilities on level 5 and a PHC (the parent of the same facilities) at level 4. In this way a facility at level 5 and a PHC at level 4 can share the same data elements and simply add together their numbers to provide the total of services provided in the geographical area.</para>
          <para>Sometimes such an aggregation is not desired, simply because it would mean duplicating data about the same population. This is the case when you have two different sources of data for two different orgunit levels. E.g. catchment population for facilities can come from a different source than district populations and therefore the sum of the facility catchment populations do not match the district population provided by e.g. census data. If this is the case we would actually want “duplicated” data in the system so that each level can have as accurate numbers as possible, but then we do NOT want to aggregate these data sources together.
</para>
          <para>In the Data Element section you can edit data elements and for each of them specify how aggregation is done for each level. In the case described above we need to tell the system NOT to include facility data on population in any of the aggregations above that level, as the level above, in this case the districts have registered their population directly as raw data. The district population data should then be used at all levels above and including the district level, while facility level should use its own data.</para>

        <section>
          <title>How to edit data element aggregation</title>
          <para>This is controlled through something called aggregation levels and at the end of the edit data element screen there is a tick-box called Aggregation Levels. If you tick that one you will see a list of aggregation levels, available and selected. Default is to have no aggregation levels defined, then all raw data in the hierarchy will be added together. To specify the rule described above, and given a hierarchy of Country, Province, District, Facility: select Facility and District as your aggregation levels. Basically you select where you have data. Selecting Facility means that Facilities will use data from facilities (given since this is the lowest level). Selecting District means that the District level raw data will be used when aggregating data for District level (hence no aggregation will take place at that level), and the facility data will not be part of the aggregated District values. When aggregating data at Province level the District level raw data will be used since this is the highest available aggregation level selected. Also for Country level aggregates the District raw data will be used. Just to repeat, if we had not specified that District level was an aggregation level, then the facility data and district data would have been added together and caused duplicate (double) population data for districts and all levels above.</para>

      <title>Data mart</title>
      <para>The purpose of the datamart is to provide pre-processed data to external data analysis and reporting tools. The datamart consists of two tables, aggregateddatavalues and aggregatedindicatorvalues in the DHIS2 database. The values in the datamart are aggregated versions of the raw data found in the datavalue table as well as calculated indicator values.. Aggregation can take place over time (e.g. from monthly data to aggregated quarterly values), or place (e.g. from PHU data to aggregated district totals) and the datamart can store all kinds of such aggregated values. The datamart is as such just a processed &quot;copy&quot; of the data values and it can be emptied and regenerated at any time, and the tables are read only tables. The metadata in the two data mart tables are referenced by internal identifiers, such as dataelementid, organisationunitid which refer to the tables like dataelement and organisationunit, see &apos;How to make use of the data mart in external tools&apos; for more on this. How the data is aggregated and what ends up in these two tables is controlled from the Data mart export user interface under the Services submenu.</para>

        <section id="datamarthowto">
          <title>How to create a data mart export</title>
          <para>In the Datamart management window click on the Add New button and a Generate data mart window will open. There are 4 selection boxes; Data elements, Indicators, Organisation units, and periods. For each of the boxes select what you want to export, note if you don&apos;t want both data elements and indicators, you can leave one of these empty, but at least on of these need some selected items together with selected orgunits and periods. The available list on the left side can be filtered by data element group, indicator group, organisation unit level, and period type accordingly. You can move items across to the selected list by double clicking on an item in the available list or by selecting an item and use the move buttons (see selection button explanations below).

</para>
          <para>When you are done selecting you can export to data mart by clicking on the Export button. If you want to keep your selections for later you can give it a name in the Name text box at the bottom of the window and click on Save. See more about saved data mart exports below.

        <section>
          <title>Orgunit levels</title>
          <para>The datamart can include values aggregated to different levels in the same table and exactly which level a value belongs to is described by the &apos;level&apos; column. When pulling data put of the datamart into external tools it is important to be aware of this level as combining data for different levels will result in duplication. 

For DHIS 1.4 users this means that there is no longer a separate table per level, but in stead on common table and a level column that separates the levels. Also note that while in 1.4 you specify in the individual data element and indicator definitions to which orgunit levels the datamart should export to, in DHIS2 this is only defined in the datamart export window. So in DHIS2 this is completely decoupled from the data element and indicator definitions and up to any user to define which orgunits (at any level) they want to see aggregated data for.
</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Period types/ data frequencies</title>
          <para>The datamart can hold values aggregated to different period types or frequencies, e.g. monthly, quarterly or yearly data. The &apos;periodtypeid&apos; refers to the frequency the value belongs to, and the periodis column refers to the exact period, e.g. the periodtype can be &apos;monthly&apos; and the period be &apos;Jan-2010&apos;. Again be careful in combining values with different periodtypes as this will cause duplication.


</para>
          <para>Which orgunits that get exported to datamart (the two tables agggregateddatavalue and aggregatedindicatorvalue) are ONLY controlled through the datamart export window, and there you define this per orgunit, not per orgunit level. There is a filter using orgunit level, but the orgunits that are selected are the only ones that end up in the datamart. Same for data elements and indicators.

</para>
          <para>Every time you do a datamart you can change which orgunits to export data for. The data values will automatically be aggregated up to the orgunit that is selected, no matter what level.

        <section>
          <title>Data element categories in the data mart</title>
          <para>Each data value for a data element has a reference to a category option combo, which is a combination of the disaggregations for the data value, e.g. (male,&lt;5y) or (In PHU, &lt;1y). These disaggregations are exported as they are to the data mart, and no aggregation is done on this dimension. See the data elements section for more on data element categories and the resource tables section for more information on how to do aggregation on these categories.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Limitation to the number of data elements per export</title>
          <para>Due to the limitation in number of columns per table in the database there is a limit to how many data elements that can be selected per data mart export. In postgres this limot is 255 (need to verify this number) data elements. If you need to export more than this number of data elements you have to split it up into multiple data mart exports and run them one by one.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Adding new data to an existing data mart</title>
          <para>When you add new data to an existing data mart the new values will be appended to the existing so that the data mart grows for each new process if new selections (such as new periods) have been made. If any of the selected values are already in the data mart then the old will be replaced by the newly generated values. </para>

        <title>Saved data mart exports</title>
        <para>To simplify this selection process you can save a datamart export, which basically means saving the selected items (not the data) so that you can run the same at a later point without re-selecting everything. New months need to be added though, while orgunits, data elements and indicators usually stay the same.</para>

        <title>Routinely data mart export procedures</title>
        <para>RELATIVE PERIODS IN DATAMART -NEW!!</para>
        <para>In a monthly data entry cycle the typical work routine would be to run all the datamart exports after the data entry process has been finalised. For each of the saved datamarts you would typically select the current reporting month and export only for that period to add the newly registered values (and aggregates based on these) to the existing data mart. If any backlog data has been entered or values for previous period have been corrected since the last data mart export then these periods also need to be added.   

E.g. in Sierra Leone they have set up a series of saved data mart exports:
- PHU all indicators
- Chiefdom (subdistrict) all indicators
- District all indicators
- PHU morbidity and mortality raw data
- PHU EPI and nutrition raw data
- PHU HIV data
- PHU RCH data
- Chiefdom Morbidity and Mortality data
- etc.

These exports are then run every month when there is new data. Each saved export is opened one by one, the new period added and the export run. 
</para>
      </section>

    <section>
      <title>Resource tables</title>
      <para>Resource tables provide additional information about the dimensions of the data in a format that is well suited for external tools to combine with the data mart tables. By joining the data mart with these resource tables one can easily aggregate along the data element category dimension or data element/indicator/organisation unit groups dimensions. E.g. by tagging all the data values with the category option male or female and provide this in a separate column &apos;gender&apos; one can get subtotals of male and female based on data values that are collected for category option combinations like (male, &lt;5) and (male,&gt;5). See the Pivot Tables section for more examples of how these can be used.

orgunitstructure is another important table in the database that helps to provide the hierarchy of orgunits together with the data. By joining the orgunitstructure table with the data mart tables you can get rows of data values with the full hierarchy, e.g. on the form:
OU1, OU2, OU3, OU4, DataElement, Period, Value
(Sierra Leone, Bo, Badija, Ngelehun CHC, BCG &lt;1, Jan-10, 32)

This format makes it much easier for e.g. pivot tables or other OLAP tools to aggregate data up the hierarchy.

    <section id="reportTable">
      <title>Report tables</title>
      <para>Report tables are meant to be database tables fulfilling the specific data needs of a report, chart, pivot table or other output format. It can be understood as a mini datamart that contains only the data needed for its purpose (the report). The rationale behind this concept is to automatically provide the data sources for reports without bothering the users every time, like a normal datamart, and to speed up the data processing and aggregation (small targeted datamarts are obviously faster than big ones).

When created and generated a report table will appear in the DHIS 2 database as a normal table, but always with the prefix _report. This table should not be altered manually as it is controlled by the system. These tables are constantly being deleted and recreated as the user wants new updated data within the same table structure. These tables can then be access and used from any third party tool for displaying data. In DHIS 2 we have integrated with the BIRT report designer from the Eclipse platform and made it especially easy to link BIRT reports to report tables and to run these reports from within DHIS 2. 

However, we see report tables as a much broader tool and concept than to just support BIRT reports. It can and should (for performance gain and automation) be used for as many data output purposes as possible. e.g. as data sources for the database views used for Excel pivot tables. </para>
      <para>
A report tables is a data source that can be defined once and then run automatically in the background when a report needs new and updated data. Standard reports (BIRT or Jasper) are directly linked to one or more report tables and these are then automatically processed in the background when the report is run. Report parameters are added to the report tables to make these generic and reusable over time or across different orgunits. </para>

          <para>You can cross-tab one or more of the following dimensions: data element/indicator, orgunit, and period, which means that columns will be created based on the values of the dimensions chosen, e.g. if indicators is selected you will get column names in the table reflecting the names of the selected indicators. You must select at least 1 dimension for the table to be valid. Selecting all 3 is possible, but makes little sense.</para>

          <para>In stead of using fixed/static periods like &apos;Jan-2010&apos; or &apos;Q1-2010&apos; more generic periods can be used to create reusable report tables, e.g. for monthly reports the period &apos;reporting month&apos; will simply pick the current reporting month selected by the user when running the report. Here is a description of the possible relative periods:

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">Reporting month:</emphasis> Use this for monthly reports. The month selected in the reporting month parameter will be used in the report.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">Last 3/6/9/12 months:</emphasis> Relative to the selected reporting month the aggregated value for the previous 3,6,9,or 12 months will be used.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">Last 3-6, 6-9, 9-12 months:</emphasis> Used for &quot;rolling quarters&quot; reports. Aggregated 3 months values will be used based on the selected reporting month. E..g if July 2010 is selected the last 3-6 period will be an aggregated period of Feb-April 2010.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">Last 12 individual months:</emphasis> Use this for monthly trend analysis. This will give 12 values, one for each of the 12 previous months relative to the chosen reporting month.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">So far this year:</emphasis> This is the cumulative so far in the year, aggregating the months from the beginning of the year up to and including the selected reporting month.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">So far this financial year:</emphasis> Similar to the above, but a cumulative value relative to start of the financial year to the selected reporting month.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">Individual months/quarter this year</emphasis>: This will provide one value per month or quarter in the  year. This is well suited for standard monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed. Periods that still have no data will be empty, but always keep the same column name.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting parameters</emphasis></para>
          <para>Report parameters make the reports more generic and reusable over time and for different orgunits. These parameters will pop up when generating the report table or running a report based on the report table and the users will select what they want to see in the report. There are three possible report parameters, and you can select to use none, 1, 2 or all 3 parameters.

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">Reporting month:</emphasis> This decides which fixed periods that will be fetched for chosen relative periods.

        <title>Using report tables</title>
        <para>To make the report tables reusable over time and across orgunits they can have \ parameters. Three types of parameters are allowed; orgunit, parent orgunit (for listing of orgunits in one area) and reporting month. As a side note I can mention that we are looking into expanding this to include reporting quarter and year, or to make that period parameter more generic with regard to period type somehow. Be able to use period as a parameter makes the report table reusable over time and as such fits nicely with report needs such as monthly, quarterly or annual reports. When a report is run by the user in the DHIS 2 the user must specify the values for the report tables that are linked to the report, and first the report table is re-generated (deleted and re-created with updated data) and then the report is run (in BIRT report engine).

</para>
        <para>Report tables can consist of either values related to data elements or indicators, and not a mix of the two. A third report table type is data completeness, which is related to completeness of reporting across orgunits for a given month. Completeness reports will be covered in a separate section. The reason for not mixing data elements and indicators in one report table is due to the cross tab functionality that would be very complex and less useful with yet another dimension. Since two or more report tables can easily be linked to one report this limitation should not have much effect on report design possibilities.

</para>
        <para>There are three dimensions in a report table that identify the data; indicators or data elements, orgunits and periods. For each of these dimensions the user can select which metadata values to include in the report. The user must select one or more data elements or indicators to appear in the report. The orgunit selection can be substituted with a parameter, wither one specific orgunit or an orgunit parent (making all its children appear in the report). If one or more orgunits are selected and no orgunit parameter is used then the report is static with regard to which orgunits to include, which in most cases is an unnecessary restriction to a report.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Using relative periods</emphasis></para>
        <para>The period selection is more advanced as it can in addition to specific periods like Jan-09, Q1-08, 2007 also contain what is called relative periods. As report usually is run routinely over time a specific period like Jan-09 is not very useful in a report. In stead, if you want to design a monthly report you could use the relative period called Reporting Month. Then you must also include Reporting Month as one of your report parameters to let the system know what exactly is the Reporting Month on the time of report generation. There are many other relative periods available and they all relate to the report parameter Reporting Month. E.g. the relative period called So far this year refers to the accumulative value for the year incl. the Reporting Month. If you want a trend report with multiple periods in stead of one aggregated period you can select e.g. Individual Months this year which would give you values for each month so far in the year, and you can do a similar report with quarters. The idea is to support as many generic report types as possible using relative periods, so if you have other report needs please suggest new relative periods on the mailing list and they will be added to the report table options.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Cross-tabbing dimensions</emphasis></para>
        <para>Cross tabbing is a very powerful functionality in report design as the typical DHIS data table with references to period, data element/indicator and orgunit makes more advanced report design very difficult as you cannot put e.g. specific indicators, periods or orgunits on specific columns. E.g. by cross-tabbing on the indicator dimension in an indicator report table you will get the indicator names on the column headers in you report, in addition to a column referencing orgunit, and another column referencing period. With such a table design you could drag and drop indicator names to specific columns or chart positions in the BIRT report design. Similarly you can cross tab on orgunits or periods to make their names specifically available to report design. E.g. by cross-tabbing on periods and selecting the two relative periods, reporting month and so far this year you can design reports with both the last month and the accumulative annual value for given month as they will be available as column headers in your report table. It is also possible to combine two dimensions in cross-tabbing, e.g. period and indicator, which makes it possible to e.g. look at three selected indicators for two specific relative periods. This would e.g. make it possible to make a table or chart based report with BCG, DPT3 and Measles coverage, both for the last month and the accumulative coverage so far in the year. 

</para>
        <para>All in all, by combining the functionality of cross tabbing, relative periods and report table parameters you should have a tool to support most report scenarios. If not we would be very happy to receive suggestions to further improvements to report tables. As already mentioned we have started to look at more fine-grained parameters for the period dimension as the Reporting Month does not cover or at least is not intuitive enough when it comes to e.g. quarterly reports.

      <para>Click OK to generate the report. After a little while, a new window will appear with the report for the given report parameters, as shown in the figure below.</para>
      <para>SCREENSHOT 4</para>
      <para>This report has been defined to show a table of ANC visits by fixed, outreach, and total, for one month (the reporting month), and one organization unit (which we selected to be Moyamba district). It also shows the data in a chart.

The other report is slightly different. It too has the report parameters reporting month and organization unit, in the example below set to July 2009 and Sierra Leone.
</para>
      <para>SCREENSHOT 5</para>
      <para>The resulting report contains the same table, but a chart showing the ANC coverages (based on expected number of pregnancies) instead of the chart of just the raw figures. </para>
      <para>SCREENSHOT 6</para>
      <para>Note that you can select to view these reports again without selecting new report parameters. Just click the icon second from left, and the report will appear with the last selected report parameters.</para>

        <title>A Step by Step guide to designing and using BIRT reports in DHIS 2</title>
        <section>
          <title>Preparations</title>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">1) Provide drivers for BIRT report designer and viewer</emphasis>
</para>
          <para>To connect to the DHIS2 database from BIRT (both when designing and viewing reports) a jdbc connection is needed, and for this you will need a jdbc driver for your database server (e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL).

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">MySQL:</emphasis> Download the driver from XX, should be on the form mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar (the exact name depends on the version)

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">PostgreSQL:</emphasis> Download the driver from XXX, should be on the form postgresql-8.3-603.jdbc3.jar (the exact name depends on the version)

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">H2:</emphasis> Download the driver from XXX, should be on the form h2-1.2.123.jar (the exact name depends on the version)

(these examples use the postgres driver, just replace as needed)</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">2)</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Designer:</emphasis>
</para>
          <para>Copy the file postgresql-8.3-603.jdbc3.jar to the folder &lt;BIRT_designer_install_path&gt;\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc_2.3.0.v20080610\drivers, for the designer version 2-3-0

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">3) Viewer:</emphasis>
</para>
          <para>The birt viewer distributed by HISP already contains the necessary drivers. If you download the BIRT viewer from the Eclipse BIRT project you need to put the driver yourself:
</para>
          <para>Copy the file postgresql-8.3-603.jdbc3.jar to the folder (inside tomcat/webapps/) &lt;BIRT_viewer_path&gt;\WEB-INF\platform\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc_2.3.0.v20080610\drivers 

</para>
          <para>This will serve as a connection between the reports to be designed and the database from which you will be fetching data.

          <title>Configure BIRT report viewer in DHIS 2</title>
          <para>In Maintenance-&gt;System Settings set the Reporting Framework to BIRT.
</para>
          <para>In Reports-&gt;Standard reports fill in the in the details on where the BIRT viewer web application is located
</para>
          <para>Home: the absolute path to your birt viwer, e.g. E:\dhis2\tomcat\webapps\birt

        <section>
          <title>Create a report table in the DHIS 2 that will serve as the data source for your report</title>
          <para>Normally you define one table per report, but multiple tables for one report is also allowed. A report table can be a cross tabulated table on any of the dimensions period/indicator/data element / orgunit, and also in combination, like “BCG &lt; 1 coverage + last 3 months” and “BCG coverage &lt; 1 year+ last month”. This cross-tabulation makes it a lot easier to control the design of the report which is then done by dragging and dropping column headings onto the report. The report table can also have report parameters like reporting month, organisation unit and organisation unit parent (if you are e.g. listing all sub-districts in a given district). See Report Tables for more details.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Design a report using the BIRT report designer</title>
          <para>The BIRT designer is a standalone desktop application based on the Eclipse platform. It can be run wither a standalone app or as part of a larger Eclipse installation. Be careful with the version you use as BIRT is very sensitive to version changes and it is important that the designer and viewer versions match.
</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">1) open a new blank report</emphasis>

</para>
          <para>Test the Connection, if successful, go for &quot;finish&quot; and you are done with the connection

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">3) set up the dataset(s) needed for the report</emphasis>

</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">4) Design the report</emphasis>
</para>
          <para>The report can then be designer using the report objects in the palette and the fields in the dataset(s). At any pint you can switch to the preview window to see how the report will look like in the BIRT viewer. The built in help tool in the BIRT designer includes a nice manual for how to design reports.

    <title>Excel Pivot Tables</title>
    <para>Pivot tables provide an excellent and dynamic data analysis tool that can be automatically linked to the DHIS2 data. Each pivot table has a connection to the database and makes use of the pivot source views (sql queries) in the database to fetch the data. These queries pull all their data from the data mart tables so it is important to keep the data mart updated at all times in order to get the most recent data into the pivot tables. A pivot table can connect to a database on the local computer or on a server. This makes it well suitable for use in a local network where there is only one shared database and multiple clients using pivot tables on their own machines. Excel can also connect to databases running on Linux. The database connection used in the pivot tables is specified in odbc data sources on the computers running pivot tables.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Using pivot tables</title>
      <para>The procedure for updating the data in the pivot tables is the following:

</para>
      <para>1) Export the data you need to the data mart (see a separate section on data mart export)
</para>
      <para>2) Refresh each pivot table to pull the most recent data from the database 
</para>
      <section>
        <title>Best practice</title>
        <para>- create copies for special reports, charts etc that you want to reuse next month
</para>
        <para>- leave the master tables more or less as is
</para>
        <para>- always possible to get the master db back and start over again if necessary

    <section>
      <title>Setting up and maintaining pivot tables</title>
      <para>With the use of the resource tables in the database we can easily get all group sets and categories over to Excel as pivot fields, which is a major improvement to the data analysis process. Here is a short how-to:

</para>
      <para/>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">First time setup</emphasis>
</para>
      <para>1) In DHIS2, Data Administration, Resource Tables, Tick all and generate
</para>
      <para>2) in DHIS2, export the data you need to the datamart
</para>
      <para>3) In database (e.g. pgAdmin), insert the pivot views (download at dhis2.org)
</para>
      <para>4) Add a Windows data source (administrative tools-&gt;data sources) that links to your database (odbc connection). x64 users on Vista and Win7 need to use the 32bit version to be able to access the postgres odbc driver. This version of the data sources program can be found in the XXX folder.
</para>
      <para>5) In Excel use the Pivot table wizard, connect to your dhis database using the odbc connection and do a select * from one of the pivot views
</para>
      <para>6) define the layout of the table (e.g. pick the dimensions you want to see)

</para>
      <para/>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">On data updates</emphasis>
</para>
      <para>1) Export the new data to datamart
</para>
      <para>2) Refresh the pivot tables
 
</para>
      <para/>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Changes needed after meta data updates (new indicators, new categories, new groups etc.)</emphasis></para>
      <para>1) Drop/delete all the pivot views in your database
</para>
      <para>2) Re-generate all the resource tables
</para>
      <para>3) Put the views back in
</para>
      <para>4) Refresh your pivot table. If you get errors referring to missing fields then you have to go back to the pivot&apos;s query designer and remove the fields that no longer exists, e.g. if a group set or category has been deleted. To get new categories or group sets in to the table you need to select these in the pivot query designer (data source) as well. Changes to category options or groups and group memberships are pulled in automatically on refresh and require no changes to the pivot query (data source).
</para>
      <section>
        <title>Create a Windows data source (ODBC)</title>
        <para>1) Download (http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/) and install (straight forward) the postgres odbc driver.

        <para>1) Open a new blank spreadsheet
</para>
        <para>2) Go to Data --&gt; PivotTable and PivotChartReport.
</para>
        <para>3) External data source --&gt; next
•Get data --&gt; choose the data source name which we made in previous step.
</para>
        <para>4) The first time you do this the first query window you get is quite poor, so click cancel and wait for Microsoft Query to open.
</para>
        <para>5) In the table selector look for the pivot_source view you need and select that.
</para>
        <para>6) Either select columns one by one or simply select all by double-clicking on the * symbol in the table</para>
        <para>
7) When you have the result set you need (you should be able to see the values in the result set table with your selected fields) you select Return to Excel in the Top menu-&gt;File
</para>
        <para>8) Go next and open the layout window
</para>
        <para>9) Drag and drop the necessary fields for your table. Make sure that routine data tables have the datavalue column in the data area
Notice: Later you can modify the field name by right clicking on it and opening &quot;Field settings&quot;, add a title, some notices and so on for a better pivot table.
</para>
        <para>10) Additional step for indicator tables:
</para>
        <para>Your indicator values should be calculated by Excel using the formula &quot;Factor*Numerator/Denominator&quot; to make sure Excel aggregates the values (such as percentages) properly. This can be done by inserting a calculated field into the Data field area. In the layout window in the wizard just put any field in data field, e.g. denominatorvalue (the wizard does not accept an empty data field). Then close and when you can see the table in normal view select the denominatorvalue field and in the top menu go to Insert-&gt;Calculated field. In the new window you can give your field the name e.g. IndicatorValue and specify the formula based on the available fields in the list to form the formula &apos;numxfactor/denominatorvalue&apos;. numxfactor is a pre-calculated value of the factor x numeratorvalue.

      <title>Conversion of geographical data to GeoJSON format</title>
      <para>The DHIS2 mapping client relies on GeoJSON files in order to display
    a map in the browser window. Often times, geographical data is received in
    many different formats, but the ESRI shape file format is one of the most
    common. Several procedures will be described below. It is important, but
    not required, that the names in your geographical data match those in the
    DHIS2 organisational hierarchy. If they do not, you will need to manually
    match them in a later step</para>
      <section>
        <title>Production of GeoJSON files with Geoserver</title>
        <para>Geoserver is capable of outputting GeoJSON formats. If you have
      geoserver running someplace, you can execute the following query.</para>
        <para>
          <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/geoserver/ows?service=WFS&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;request=GetFeature&amp;typename=topp:states&amp;outputformat=json&amp;srs_name=EPSG:4326">http://localhost:8080/geoserver/ows?service=WFS&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;request=GetFeature&amp;typename=topp:states&amp;outputformat=json&amp;srs_name=EPSG:4326</ulink>
        </para>
        <para> Take note that you need to specify the spatial coordinate system. By default, Geoserver will return GeoJSON files with the format "long/lat" while
the DHIS mapping client expects the ordering of the coordinates in "lat/long" format.  The explicit declaration of the spatial reference system will ensure that coordinates are returned in the proper order. At the time of writing, the DHIS mapping client does not support spatial reference systems other than EPSG 4326. If you are using Geoserver, the application will handle the reprojection from the native format of the geographical data to EPSG 4326. If you are using other methods as described below to generate the GeoJSON file, you will need to ensure that the GeoJSON output is set to EPSG 4326 (Geographical Lat/long). </para>
        <para>You will need to adjust the host destination if the machine is not
      your local machine as well as defining the actual layer in Geoserver
      which should be output to GeoJSON (in this case
      <parameter>topp:states</parameter>).</para>
        <para>Upon execution of the URL, Geoserver will produce a GeoJSON file,
      and you will be asked to save it. Once it has finished downloading,
      rename the file following the suggested naming convention:</para>
        <para>ISO2CountryCode followed by an underscore, followed by the layer
      type (e.g. “admin” for administrative layers, “health” for health
      administrative boundaries). For instance, the first administrative layer
      for Zambia would be named as "zm_admin1".</para>

        <title>Copying files to the DHIS application</title>
        <para>Currently, your GeoJSON files should be placed in the

          You can also use the background map of the DHIS GIS module, and

    relations between OUs in the database and the corresponding OUs in the
    shapefile. This is often necessary because of inconsistencies in the
    naming in the geographical data, and what is present in the DHIS database.
    First, try auto-assign at the bottom toolbar to let the application link
    the OUs with a matching OU name in the shapefile. The polygons that remain
    white, you will have to link manually by first selecting a white OU in the
    list and then click the corresponding OU in the map.</para>

    <title>DHIS 2 Excel Reporting</title>
    <para>A key requirement of a health information system is that the information contained in the system is available in many different formats that are familiar to the end-users. Many health information personnel are familiar with standard office productivity packages such as <productname>Microsoft Office</productname> or OpenOffice. Production of reports in Excel format allows health workers to submit reports to managers and other persons that may not have access to the HMIS, or lack training in its use. Excel offers the capability to deliver powerful, user-friendly reports to many different clients of the information system.</para>
    <para>Users, especially health workers, can use DHIS 2 easily with the new Excel reporting tool developed by HISP Vietnam team.  This module has been  based on HISP India team’s ideas and technologies.  The module has subsequently been merged into the main DHIS2 application.  This reporting tool with Excel output files uses less memory and  is comparatively faster when compared to other reporting modules</para>
